        Internship and my First Dev Job with Bit Space Development
      </Typography>

      <BlogParagraph>
        The MITT Software Developer program, when I took it, concluded with a
        ~2-month work placement with a local business. &quot;Internship&quot; is
        a word that comes with some baggage, but I trusted the process. I was
        told there was only a slim chance that I’d get paid for this placement,
        but the work experience would be more valuable.

        The process of pairing up with a local business was fairly smooth in
        hindsight. Our class was told to submit our resumes to{" "}

        (the internship coordinator), who would then send them out to a whole
        bunch of business partners, and those partners would select which
        candidates to interview. I don’t recall all of my interviews, but I
        remember having 5 of them. I ranked my favourites, and passed that info
        to Jessica.

        and got to talking about video games and VR technology. I was excited.
        Very excited. I was going to write software for a video game company,
        literally the dream of many nerds like myself.

        When instructions for the remote work arrived in my inbox, I felt a
        small compulsion to &quot;audit&quot; one of their daily standups. The
        Friday before I was supposed to begin, I hopped into the digital
        chatroom, and waited for everyone else to show up. Dan began the standup
        meeting, and speaking order began to rotate through the room. About
        halfway around the circle, the person next to me passed the turn… to me.
        I wasn’t expecting this. They only had ~15 employees, and I thought
        they’d all know each other. I thought they’d simply skip over me like I
        was invisible. The spotlight was mine, and I didn’t know what to say. I
        took just a short moment to think about how each person spoke before me,
        and dove in. 13 years working in a casino got me a heap of
        improvisational conversation skill, and I wasn’t about to be caught with
        a slack jaw in a moment like this.

        &quot;Hi, I’m Alex Gilmer, one of the interns who’s supposed to start
        next week. I wanted to see how things work, and came a day early to see
        the daily standup. I look forward to working with you on Monday! I’ll
        pass it on to &lt;next person in the circle&gt;.&quot; I think my
        eagerness left a positive impression. Dan commented that he &quot;liked
        the initiative.&quot;

      <BlogParagraph>
        On Monday, I began working on the web portion of their
        &quot;VRSafety&quot; project. I was introduced to{" "}

        , the project manager. I remember coming home from my first in-office
        day, and exclaiming to my wife &quot;I work with a bunch of NERDS! It’s
        AWESOME!&quot; It felt like a home-away-from-home. The Wi-Fi password
        was the name of a video game character. There was video game memorabilia
        all around. Everyone was friendly and willing to chat pretty much any
        time.

        My tenure on that project was short, though. Just ~3 weeks in to the
        work, I was approached by Dan again. &quot;Hey Alex, how would you feel
        learning a brand new programming language for one of our projects?&quot;
        I was absolutely down. I’m nothing if not a fast study, eager to please,
        and I always love a good challenge. They gave me login credentials for

        I took to it quickly. They gave me a week to learn, but I was already
        writing code and fixing bugs by the end of day 2. I quickly ingratiated
        myself to Riel with my nothing-is-impossible attitude towards
        programming and sharp eye for fine details.

      <BlogParagraph>
        Just after Christmas, about ~3 weeks from completing the internship, I
        get to have another chat with Dan. &quot;Hey Alex, do you have plans
        after the internship? Would you like to continue working on EventCamp,{" "}
        <em>for money</em>?&quot; Apparently, my skills had been noticed. Dan
        commented that my daily standups stood out for clarity and consistency.
        Jameel and Violet had reported that my work ethic was solid. Riel
        reported that I was easy to work with.

      <BlogParagraph>
        It was a dream to me. This was it. This was the goal, the entire reason
        that I enrolled in MITT. I wanted to write programming code, and now
        someone wanted to pay me to do it. I worked at Bit Space Development for
        another 7 months after my internship ended, and I loved every moment of
        it. The next chapter of my career begins with a fateful meeting and I’ll
        go into detail on it in the next post.

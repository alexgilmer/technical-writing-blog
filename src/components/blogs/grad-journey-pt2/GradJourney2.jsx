        First Year at MITT

      <BlogParagraph>
        Things have been going pretty hunky-dory at BSD. I enjoyed working on
        EventCamp, and spending a bit of time also assisting other BSD projects.
        In July, after about 8 months of steady work with BSD, I got a call from{" "}
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrismacdonald3/">
          Chris MacDonald
        </a>
        , my former MITT instructor: &quot;Hey Alex, the SD program at MITT is
        expanding, and we’re hiring a new assistant. <em>My</em> new assistant.
        I want you to be that person.&quot;
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogParagraph>
        Jaw, meet floor. This opportunity was golden. I have two career
        passions: programming and teaching. Here I was, offered a job that would
        let me do both. Sure, it was just an assistant position, but Chris
        promised a path: he intended to train me to be his eventual replacement.
        This was a path that others at MITT had walked before. Multiple
        at-the-time current MITT instructors were former assistants.

      <BlogParagraph>
        BSD was sad to see me go. I was integral to the EventCamp team and they
        asked me for a part time freelance contract that wouldn’t interfere with
        my work at MITT. I was overjoyed, and we quickly arrived at an
        understanding. I got to live the best of both worlds, teaching in an
        academic environment and maintaining industry presence.

        were the other SD instructors, and there were the networking instructors
        and assistants &quot;across the hall.&quot; Chris and I would be taking
        care of the PTEC program students.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogParagraph>
        PTEC was an accelerated college program delivered to high school
        students. Quickly summarized, we had a class of grade 12 students each
        morning, and a class of grade 11 students in the afternoons. Following
        in the post-secondary SD pathway (but at half-speed), the elevens were
        learning about front end web development, and the twelves were past that
        and on to back end programming.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogParagraph>
        We had a small problem, though. Chris’ specialty was front end web
        development, but he was less experienced with back end programming. We
        were inheriting the work of the previous back end instructor Mohamad
        Alhamoud. Mohamad had been my back end instructor when going through
        this course. He was a very smart man but also, unfortunately, a large{" "}

        . His teaching materials consisted of a collection of short and simple
        documents that mainly contained basic topics and some assignments.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogParagraph>
        Chris and I spent a large amount of time throughout the year filling out
        those materials. Chris wanted to end the knowledge-siloed system of
        teaching SD at MITT and put together a &quot;master curriculum.&quot;
        That also meant that our grade 12 students were kind of guinea pigs as
        we developed and expanded course content. I still feel bad about the
        &quot;sandwich assembler program&quot; assignment. To any of our
        students reading this who suffered through that one, you have my
        apologies.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogParagraph>
        Something big happened about halfway through this year. The day that I
        called &quot;happiest day of my life&quot; became second place to a new
        one: my wife was pregnant with our first child. We had been trying for
        nearly 3 years. I still remember calling Jared that morning and saying
        that I needed a personal day off to celebrate. He cried with joy on my
        behalf, too. Life was about to become a lot more busy and interesting.
        My freelance work suffered a hit to availability, but didn’t stop.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogParagraph>
        Near the end of the year, Chris and Tavare (the PTEC networking
        instructor) asked me to put on a challenge event for the students.
        Earlier in the year, we held a simple coding competition for the PTEC SD
        students and they both felt that we could expand this to challenge both
        SD and Networking students alike. The PTEC Hackathon was born. I put in
        a heap of hours outside of work to build the system. It would track
        teams of students and permit them to submit the points that they
        capture. I worked closely with the Networking assistants to build a
        system for the students to &quot;hack&quot; into, and filled it with
        puzzles and challenges that would award points. I hosted it on Azure.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogParagraph>
        It was almost a flop. Apparently, we chose &quot;senior skip day&quot;
        for the event. 8 students (out of ~30) showed up. 2 networking students
        were graciously loaned to us from one of the post-secondary classes to
        allow us to form two teams of 5. It was a fun time! For about 3 hours,
        the students worked furiously to one-up each other. Jared pulled some
        strings and ensured that all 10 students received prizes as a reward for
        showing up. MITT sweaters all around!
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogParagraph>
        I was looking forward to next year. I felt comfortable. I knew that
        challenging times were ahead, but I was prepared. I wanted v2 of the
        Hackathon to be bigger and better. I knew more about the teaching
        profession and was eager to continue my career ascent. We had a baby on
        the way. Things wound up even more spicy than expected.
